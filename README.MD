## Snakes and Ladders game

The game consists of two players "player 1 and player 2" who roll the dice with the objectieve to move their coins and get it to the 100 point on the board before the other player does.
The coins starting positions are at 1 on the board. If a player rolls a six on the dice they are given another chance to roll agin. If a coin reaches the position where ther is a ladder it is pushed forward and up the board to where the ladder ends and the player gets to roll again. If a coin reaches the mouth of asnke it is "swallowed" and is pulled down the board to where the tail ends.

The code is explained briefly as follows:

Importing necessary modules:

1. tkinter: Provides the GUI (Graphical User Interface) for the game.
2. PIL.ImageTk, PIL.Image: Used for loading and displaying images.
3. random: Used for generating random numbers for dice rolls.
4. gtts.gTTS: Used for text-to-speech conversion.
5. playsound: Used for playing audio files.
6. os: Used for removing temporary audio files.

Defining the Speak function:

This function takes a text input, converts it to speech using the gTTS library, saves it as an audio file, and plays the audio using playsound.
The temporary audio file is then removed.

Defining the start_game function:

This function is called to set up the game interface.
It creates buttons for the players, a dice button, and an exit button.
The buttons are placed on the GUI using the place method.

Defining the reset_coins function:

This function is called to reset the positions of the player coins to the starting position.
It moves the player 1 and player 2 coins to the starting position.
It also resets the pos1 and pos2 variables to 0.

Defining the load_dice_images function:

This function is called to load the dice images used in the game.
It reads the dice images from files, resizes them, and stores them in the Dice list.

Defining the check_ladder function:

This function checks if a ladder is present at the current position for the given turn.
If a ladder is found, it updates the player's position accordingly.
The function returns a flag (f) indicating whether a ladder was found or not.

Defining the check_snake function:

This function checks if a snake is present at the current position for the given turn.
If a snake is found, it updates the player's position accordingly.

Defining the roll_dice function:

This function is called when the dice button is clicked.
It generates a random number between 1 and 6 to simulate a dice roll.
The corresponding dice image is displayed on the GUI.
The function updates the player's position, checks for ladders and snakes, moves the player's coin, and switches the turn between players.
The function also checks if a player has reached position 100 (winning position) and announces the winner.

Defining the is_winner function:

This function checks if a player has reached the winning position (position 100).
If player 1 or player 2 reaches the winning position, a message is displayed on the GUI and the coins are reset.

Defining the move_coin function:

This function moves the player's coin on the GUI based on the given turn and position.
It uses the place method to set the new coordinates of the coin.
It also announces the player's current position using the Speak function.

Defining the get_index function:

This function sets up the mapping of positions to coordinates on the GUI.
It initializes the Index dictionary with the corresponding x and y coordinates for each position on the board.
Creating the Tkinter window and setting up the game:

The window dimensions and title are set using tk.Tk() and geometry and title methods.
The game board image is loaded and displayed on the GUI.
Player 1 and Player 2 buttons are created.
Player 1 and Player 2 coins are created using the Canvas widget.
The initial turn is set to 1.
The reset_coins, get_index, load_dice_images, Speak, and start_game functions are called.
The Tkinter event loop is started using root.mainloop().
This code provides a basic implementation of the Snake and Ladders game using a GUI. Players take turns rolling the dice, and their positions on the game board are updated accordingly. The game checks for ladder and snake positions and announces the winner when a player reaches position 100.
